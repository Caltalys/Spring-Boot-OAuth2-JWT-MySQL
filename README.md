# Full Security Login System with Spring Boot

This project contains all the configuration about an authentication and authorization system. 
We are using spring boot framework, spring security, spring oauth token and mysql. Cause we want ours projects be scalable as 
they can we are using the JWT token key for authentication with oauth2, this means that we donâ€™t need sessions and  session 
storage system so our application will work faster and better even in cloud server without any configuration.
